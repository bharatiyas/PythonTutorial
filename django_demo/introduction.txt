 Django:
 1. It is an open source web app framework
 2. Has automatic admin interface which supports CRUD operations
 3. It gives you some predefined components and functions which you can use to do backend programming in Python
 4. Django provides framework for ORM
 5. It provides with SQLite as in-built DB

 Install Django
 Start a Django project go the desired folder and then type:

 django-admin startproject mysite
 If the above command does not work then try:

 py -m django startproject <your_project_name>

 Now create a django app. One django project can have multiple apps.
 cd <your_project_name>
 django-admin startapp myapp

 If the above command does not work then try:
 py -m django startapp myapp

 Django has a local server to run the application for local development
 python manage.py runserver

 You will be able to open the home page of the server by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/

 Templates allows us to generate HTML dynamically. But you need a templating engine to generate a HTML from a
 templating engine. Django has its own templating engine.
 Django first finds the template in its templates/<myapp> directory

Then it renders the HTML with the context data (by replacing the values).
