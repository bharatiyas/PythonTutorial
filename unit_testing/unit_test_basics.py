# PyTest
# ------
# 1. It is a testing framework for Python
# 2. Auto-descovery of tests - pick up tests based on how we name them. 
#       Ex, based on name of the test file like test_filename.py or function_name_test()
# 3. Rich assetion introspection - when a test fails we get details on why and where did the test failed
# 4. Supports parameterized and fixture-based testing - Easily run a test multiple times with different 
#       arguments. This saves lot of effort.
# 5. We can run tests individually
# 6. It has very Simplified Syntax
# 7. Powerful Fixture System - Enables setup and tear down code
# 8. Compatibility  - It can support or run with different testing lib
# 9. Extensibility - Rich plug-in architecture. Like, Django test plugin
# 10. Easier to use and more powerful than the unittest library shipped defaultly with Python

# Unit test - help you to test your code (and changes made later) quick and easy
